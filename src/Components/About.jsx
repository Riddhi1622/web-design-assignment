            applications. I try to  write code that brings to life the visual and interactive elements of a 
            website, such as the layout, design, and functionality of the user interface. 

            My full name is Divya Bhamerkar. (nickname: RIDDHI)
            My student id is:- 200535453

           <p> As of now, I have not adding much content in all the pages, just enough to show that all the pages are working
            properly. </p>
